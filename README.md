# Weather Data Analysis (Toronto 2012)
This project analyzes hourly weather data from Toronto in 2012 to uncover patterns in temperature, humidity, visibility, and weather conditions. It uses Python and pandas for data manipulation, with visualizations powered by seaborn and matplotlib.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes 8 columns and 8,784 hourly records:

Date/Time: Timestamp of the observation

Temp_C: Temperature in Celsius

Dew Point Temp_C: Dew point temperature

Rel Hum_%: Relative humidity percentage

Wind Speed_km/h: Wind speed in km/h

Visibility_km: Visibility in kilometers

Press_kPa: Atmospheric pressure in kilopascals

Weather: Description of weather conditions

# Key Questions Explored
What are the unique weather conditions recorded?

How often was the weather exactly "Clear"?

What are the unique wind speeds and their frequencies?

What is the mean visibility and standard deviation of pressure?

How many times did snow occur, and under what conditions?

What is the average stop duration and humidity variance?

How do weather conditions affect temperature, humidity, and visibility?

# Technologies Used
Python 

pandas

numpy

seaborn

matplotlib

# Sample Insights
"Mainly Clear" and "Mostly Cloudy" were the most frequent weather conditions.

The average visibility was 27.66 km, and the pressure had a standard deviation of 0.84 kPa.

Snow was recorded 390 times, with additional snowy variants like "Snow Showers" and "Snow, Fog.

Wind speeds ranged from 0 to 83 km/h, with 34 unique values.

The weather condition "Clear" occurred 1,326 times.
